<p>The objective with this project is to create a Mobile Application,
where it is possible for residents and business customers to communicate with
their landlords from rental agencies.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Until now, this application has been developed in React Native in IOS-Platform.
If your are MAC-user, we strongly recommend you to install XCode from AppStore.</p>
<p>To view the application, the visitor must open the following things at first:</p>
<p>1. Two Console Terminals</p>
<p>2. XCode in order to make the Device Available when running commands.</p>

<p>To startup the application, please the following commands.</p>
<p>1. At Console/Terminal 1, you have to run:</p>

```npm start```

<p>2. At Console/Terminal 2, you have to run:</p>

```npm run ios```

<p>After running these commands, while XCode being open. 
The user should be able to see the application.</p>
