<h4>Please look at the information below for lacks and important notices:</h4>

<p>The objective with this project is to create a Mobile Application,
where it is possible for residents and business customers to communicate with
their landlords from rental agencies.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Until now, this application has been developed in React Native in IOS-Platform.
If your are MAC-user, we strongly recommend you to install XCode from AppStore.</p>
<p>To view the application, the visitor must open the following things at first:</p>
<p>1. Two Console Terminals</p>
<p>2. XCode in order to make the Device Available when running commands.</p>

<p>To startup the application, please the following commands.</p>
<p>1. At Console/Terminal 1, you have to run:</p>

```npm start```

<p>2. At Console/Terminal 2, you have to run:</p>

```npm run ios```

<p>After running these commands, while XCode being open. 
The user should be able to see the application.</p>

<h1>Any Errors?</h1>
<p>If any errors occur, we recommend the user on opening the project in XCodeWorkspace</p>
<p>Otherwise we recommend the user to run the following command,
in order to update the dependencies.</p>

```npm install```

<h4>Lacks and Problems</h4>
<p>It is important to notice that under the crud-operations, all the code that has been provided there is not implemented due to problems with firebase.</p>
<p>The application only allows authentication, signup and case-filing, where it is saved to authentication and datastore.</p>
<p>Because of price-issues storage has not been included, though notifications are under process since there have been some dependency issues.</p>
<p>As discussed with the Project Manager. The MVP is in React Native, though we have tried our best to include firebase as much as possible.</p>
<p>For the Senior Developer, we advise you to look at the managers-folder under the functions-folder instead of crud-operations folder.</p>
<p>We hope that the senior manager is satisfied with results of the customer-side application.</p>
